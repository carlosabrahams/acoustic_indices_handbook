# Using Acoustic Indices

## Environmental monitoring

Acoustic methods have the potential to expand environmental monitoring into new methods and metrics, through the application of acoustic indices. Such an approach does not provide species-level data (although this can be extracted from the same audio recordings if needed), but provides a quantification of the soundscape character recorded at the site. Acoustic indices could therefore be used to assess habitat quality in different locations or habitats, or to monitor changes in the environment over time - with the resolution of that data only really constrained by data storage and processing implications.

The use of Acoustic Indices for environmetal monitoring is potentially very promising, and an efficient approach to implement for ecoacoustic technology. With repeated recordings through a day, season or year, these metrics can be tracked over time, or compared between locations to look at spatial relatioships. Acoustic indices, can be used as a proxy for biodiversity or environmental quality, and have been linked with measures of species richness, community structure and phenology [@Buxton2016; @Fuller2015; @Lellouch2014; @Towsey2014]. The methods of use are hence becoming established, but will require calibrating within different settings to understand how indices relate to land management, habitat types etc.

## Temporal soundscapes

Soundscapes, and the resulting acoustic indices, vary over time, with clear diel, seasonal and inter-annual patterns. Diel patterns are particularly pronounced in a number of habitats/biomes, with consistent distinctions between day and night being found, for example [@Bradfer-Lawrence2019].

## Spatial/habitat soundscapes

Consistent differences amongst soundscapes from different land-use types have been found, with some Acoustic Indices (e.g. mean ACI) providing good fine‐scale discrimination among a range of habitats [@Bradfer-Lawrence2019; @Fuller2015; @Pieretti2015]. This is due to the overall species assemblage present at each location, as well as the influence of wind and rain sound in different vegetation classes such as pasture or forested areas. Distinct patterns in acoustic indices have also been found in urban habitats, as well as farmed or semi-natural areas [@Fairbrass2017; @Joo2011].


A number of studies have investigated the links between acoustic indices and habitat type or land management practices:

-   [@Villanueva-Rivera2011] used the Acoustic Evenness [AEI] index across a variety of habitats [including crop lands] in the USA, finding that it may be a reliable proxy for biodiversity.

-   [@Depraetere2012] tested Acoustic Richness [AR] across three different habitat types with varying levels of disturbance in Europe, finding a correlation with bird species richness.

-   [@Tucker2014] investigated soundscapes in fragmented forest remnants. This indicated that the measurement of relative soundscape power reflects ecological condition and bird species richness, and is dependent on the extent of landscape fragmentation, and the consequent size and connectedness of forest patches.

-   [@Bobryk2015] compared different agricultural systems -- soybean monoculture, pecan alley crop, silvopasture and natural forest. This indicated significant relationships between Acoustic Complexity Index and the overall structural complexity of the habitats [measured using vegetation height], and with the overall species richness identified by manual review of the audio recordings.

-   [@Gage2015] applied the Normalized Difference Soundscape Index [NDSI] across different vegetation types in agricultural environments, including winter wheat, successional forest and Poplar dominated forest. The results showed that NDSI had a positive relationship with biotic activity, with the lowest values found in agricultural dominated landscapes and highest in Poplar dominated forest.

-   [@Eldridge2018] compared a range of acoustic indices from recordings in ancient woodland, regenerating farmland with patches of woodland, and a downland barley farm. Species richness and acoustic indices were highest in the semi-natural habitats, and lowest in the arable farmland.

-   [@Turner2018] investigated the effects of stand-age [0--85 years] and structure on the acoustic properties of plantations in Thetford Forest. Moderate relationships were observed between acoustic diversity and forest stand-age and vegetation characteristics [canopy height; canopy cover]. A strong linear relationship was observed between distance to the nearest road and the ratio of anthropogenic noise to biological sounds within the soundscape.

-   [@Myers2019] used acoustic indices to compare the soundscapes of organic and conventional olive groves in Greece, using Acoustic Complexity Index [ACI], the Acoustic Diversity Index [ADI] and the Bioacoustic Index [BIO]. Olive groves under organic farming had significantly higher values for the ACI and BIO indices, and higher, but not significant, values for the ADI index. Site level variables, especially underlying vegetation height, had a significant influence on the ACI and BIO indices.

-   [@Furumo2019] compared the acoustic features of different land cover types in and around neotropical oil palm plantations, finding that soundscape analysis was effective in differentiating land uses. Their forest soundscapes were significantly different from the soundscapes of oil palm production sites, demonstrating the potential of acoustic monitoring to rapidly evaluate the effects of landscape-level changes on biodiversity.

-   [@Campos-Cerqueira2019] evaluated the impact of Forest Stewardship Council certification at certified forestry sites and non‐FSC forestry sites, and unmanaged reference sites. Soundscape variation was best explained by the management type, with FSC sites having higher values than the reference and non‐FSC sites especially.

-   [@Muller2020] investigated the effects of habitat patch size on acoustic diversity, using forest 'island' patches within an agricultural landscape. They found that Acoustic Diversity Index values were positively related to habitat size, vegetation structural diversity and bird species richness.

-   [@Dixon2020] explored the potential to monitor biodiversity in agricultural landscapes by linking high-resolution remote sensing by drone with passive acoustic monitoring. Analysis revealed a significant direct association between vocalizing bird species richness and percent non-crop vegetation cover.

These studies, although mostly taking place in different countries and habitat types than in the UK, all indicate that acoustic indices can effectively detect differences in land management practices. They show that 'environmentally-friendly' farming and forestry practices, such as organic production and FSC certification, result in a more diverse soundscape and higher value acoustic index scores. The same pattern is likely to be found in comparison between standard farming practices and AES within the UK - although this still remains to be demonstrated.

An interesting finding from [@Eldridge2018] is worth highlighting. Their analysis suggested that between-habitat differences in acoustic indices were greater than differences in bird species lists. This indicates that acoustic assessments could potentially provide a more complete measure of biodiversity than traditional avian surveys. Potential explanations for this are:

1. differences in vocalization characteristics of registered species, such as skylarks in agricultural land and pheasants in forest, both species having very distinct calls which strongly impact many of the indices values;
2. prevalence of non-avian taxa;
3. site-specific differences in anthrophony, such as airplanes, generators or human voice; 
4. site-specific differences in geophony [wind, rain], potentially augmented by the impact of habitat structural variation on propagation of acoustic signals. 

Importantly, for application in European temperate habitats, this study also observed stronger relationships between indices and species richness in the UK than have been reported in other recent studies, many of which have been carried out in tropical environments, where results may have been confounded by other vocalizing taxa - such as large insect choruses.

# Acoustic Entropy [H, Hf, Ht]

> [@Doohan2019] - The **Acoustic Entropy [H]** index [@Sueur2008] measures the overall randomness [i.e. entropy] of noise within a recording and is the most frequently used for biodiversity assessment. While the H index is not a direct measure of biodiversity per se, studies in eastern Australian woodlands and African tropical rainforests have found it to be highly correlated with bird species diversity [Fuller2015; @Sueur2008]. In contrast, the Acoustic Complexity Index [ACI] removes sources of underlying noise before quantifying the number of unique signals in the sound [Pieretti2011]. This is particularly ad- vantageous in environments where broadband sounds, such as those produced by insects, are more prevalent [Pieretti2011]. The ACI value is indicative of the complexity of the sound, with more complex recordings receiving higher ACI scores. More complex sounds can be conceptually linked to more animal sounds and higher biodiversity [Pieretti2011; Farina2016]. While most studies rely on this assumption, a correlation between ACI and bird activity [i.e. number of calls] was found in Mediterranean Europe [Farina2011; Pieretti2011].

> [@Jorge2018] - the entropy index [H] [[@Sueur2008][]], showed no correlation with the number of bird species in our studied site.


> [@Ross2021] found that temporal entropy *Ht* was related negatively to richness, consistent with other tests of this index [Buxton2018a; @Eldridge2018]. *Ht* was significantly related to measured richness under two sonic conditions. Ht correlated with richness in the presence of geophony, but to our knowledge, the performance of Ht has not been tested previously under these conditions; the index was developed and tested by Sueur[2008b] after applying a high-pass filter to remove the sonic effects of wind. Ht also performed well in the presence of anthropophony, and Depraetere[2012] note that Ht was not affected by anthropogenic background noise in their study.

> \@[@Eldridge2018] - Based on the foundational premise that biodiversity can be inferred from acoustic diversity, several indices draw an analogy between species distribution and distribution of energy in a spectrum, where each frequency band is seen to represent a specific 'species'. The entropy indices Hf and Ht [[@Sueur2008][]] are calculated as the Shannon entropy of a probability mass function [PMF] and designed to increase with species diversity. For Hf the PMF is derived from the mean spectrum, for Ht from the amplitude envelope. Their product is H. Early studies reported higher values for intact over degraded tropical forests [[@Sueur2008][]], but subsequent testing in a temperate [woodland][] reported contradictory results, attributed to background technophonies [[@Depraetere2012][]]. H has since been reported to show positive, moderate correlations with [avian species][] richness across multiple habitats in China [[Mammides2017][]] and a variant of Ht [Acoustic Richness] was shown to be positively associated with observed species richness [[@Depraetere2012][]]. These entropy and evenness measures encapsulate the foundational assumption of RAS, but are not intuitive to interpret.

# Bioacoustic index [BI]

> [@Myers2019] - The **Bioacoustic index** [[Boelman2007][]] is an estimate of avian abundance, measuring both the number of frequency bands and the volume level of avian activity. It is calculated by finding the area under the mean frequency spectrum and has been shown to correlate strongly with direct visual ornithological surveys in the field [[Eldridge2016][]] and changes in avian species richness from aural observations [[@Depraetere2012][]]. The default parameters were used for all indices, with the exception of setting the maximum and minimum frequency levels to 16,000 Hz and 2000 Hz when calculating BIO, which is more appropriate for capturing avian frequencies than the default setting.

> @[@Eldridge2018] - Rather than applying extant ecological metrics to [acoustic data][], other ecoacoustic indices have been designed more intuitively; the Bioacoustic Index [BI] was designed to capture overall sound pressure levels across the range of frequencies produced by [avifauna][] [[Boelman2007][]]. BI was originally reported to correlate strongly with changes in avian abundance in Hawaiian forests [[Boelman2007][]], but subsequent assessments have been mixed, showing significant association with avian species richness [[Fuller2015][]] and both positive and negative weaker correlations [[Mammides2017][]] in areas with multiple vocalizing taxa. Despite an initially strong demonstration of efficacy, and conceptual and computational simplicity, this index has been excluded from many recent analyses [[Harris2016][]].

> @[@Eldridge2018] - The Bioacoustic Index showed the best overall performance, being the strongest predictor of avian species richness in both ecozones and showing strong positive correlations with species richness in the UK and biophonic density in Ecuador and the UK. This result corroborates previous studies which report strong correlations between BI and avian species abundance [[Boelman2007][]], number of bird vocalizations [[Pieretti2011][]] and biotic diversity [[Fairbrass2017][]]. The superior performance of BI over other indices could be attributed to the fact that it is calculated across a narrower frequency range, potentially strengthening the relationship with biophony by reducing sensitivity to low frequency engine and wind noise and high frequency components of insect calls. This is a simple but important considering in the design of future indices. **Future indices could be band limited and tuned to the range of calls of interest**.

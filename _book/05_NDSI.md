# Normalized Difference Soundscape Index [NDSI]

> [@Doohan2019] - The **Normalized Difference Soundscape Index [NDSI]** is the ratio of technophony to biophony in the soundscape [Kasten2012] and has been used in subtropical woodlands [Fuller2015], temperate forests [Gage and Axel, 2014], and monoculture crops [Gage2015]. While this index does not measure acoustic diversity per se, it has been shown to be correlated with bird species richness and ecological condition in fragmented landscapes [Fuller2015]. Gage[2015] also used NDSI to explore how biophony-dominated soundscapes change across different vegetation types in agricultural environments, including winter wheat, successional forest and Poplar dominated forest. The results showed that NDSI had a positive relationship with biotic activity in general, with the lowest values found in agri-cultural dominated landscapes and highest in Poplar dominated forest

> [@Ross2021] Both *NDSI* and *NDSIBio* were insensitive to the three sonic focal conditions, likely because NDSI compares a ratio of acoustic energy in high frequency to low frequency bands, making it relatively insensitive to broadband sounds of evenly distributed amplitude across frequencies, while NDSIBio excludes frequency bands associated with anthropophony [Kasten2012]. Of the indices designed to be insensitive to anthropophony --- ACI, ADiv, BioA, NDSI [see Fairbrass2017] --- biophony [NDSIBio] was most robust to anthropogenic noise.

> [@Fuller2015] - The NDSI provided a pattern that was broadly a combination of both ACI/BIO and *H*/ADI. High nighttime values of this index reflect high biophony relative to anthrophony, suggesting that like *H* and ADI, there is a high level of nocturnal biophony [insects, amphibians] that is detected during the quiet of night, when there is low anthrophony and other background sounds. According to Krause's acoustic [niche partitioning][] hypothesis, amphibians and insects tend to signal at night to avoid bird predators as the soundscape is a finite resource in which animals compete for spectral space [[Krause, 2012][]]. The drop in NDSI just before dawn may likely represent a transition from night signaling species to day signaling species. Clear temporal windows occupied by specific groups [insects at night, distinct dawn and dusk bird choruses] have also been observed in New [Caledonian][] forests [[@Gasc2013][]]. The relatively low NDSI values observed throughout the day may also indicate a shift in the ratio of anthrophony to biophony with higher levels of anthropogenic sound increasing throughout the day relative to biological sounds.

> \@[@Eldridge2018] - The *Normalised Difference Sound Index* [NDSI] [[Kasten2012][]] seeks to describe the level of anthropogenic disturbance by calculating the ratio of mid-frequency biophony to lower frequency technophony in field recordings, the values for each being computed from an estimate of power density spectrum [[Welch, 1967][]]. In long term studies, the NDSI has been shown to reflect assumed seasonal and [diurnal variation][] across landscapes [[Kasten2012][]]. It has subsequently been shown to be sensitive to biophony and anthrophony levels in urban areas [[Fairbrass2017][]] and to be an indicator of anthropogenic presence in the Brazilian [Cerrado][] [[Alquezar and Machado, 2015][]]. NDSI has also been evaluated as a proxy for species diversity with mixed results: significant relationships with bird species richness have reported across mixed habitats in China [[Mammides2017][]]; in Brazilian [savanna][] habitats no relationships were observed [[Alquezar and Machado, 2015][]].

> \@[@Eldridge2018] - Although NDSI was developed to capture anthropogenic disturbance, rather than acoustic community diversity, significant relationships with bird species richness have been reported elsewhere [[Fuller2015][]], however weak and non-significant correlations have also been observed [[Mammides2017][]]. The moderate, positive correlations observed here between species richness and biophonic density likely reflect an overall increase in biophonies relative to background technophonies -- which were present in all habitats here -- supporting the use of NDSI as a high-level measure of anthropogenic disturbance. As has been highlighted elsewhere, assumptions over frequency range of anthrophony and biophony may be over simplistic: frequency components of anthropogenic and biotically generated sounds are not necessarily strictly band-limited, but could potentially be tuned to meet local characteristics. For example, calls of the Ecuadorian Toucan [barbet][] [*Semnornis ramphastinus*] contain spectra as low as 300 Hz, well below the default 2 kHz lower limit of biophony in NDSI. **Ranges for frequency-dependent indices could be tuned to particular characteristics of local communities of interest**.

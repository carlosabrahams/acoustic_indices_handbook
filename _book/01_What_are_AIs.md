# What are Acoustic Indices

Audio recordings can be analysed with acoustic indices to examine the composition and diversity of all recorded vocalising organisms, as well as other acoustic features of the soundscape, such as environmental and human sounds [e.g. engines and machinery] [@Farina2016; @Gasc[@2016]; @Pijanowski2011; @Sueur2015; @Towsey2014]. It is generally regarded that complex habitats contain a higher diversity of vocalising species, which produce more, and varied, acoustic signals [@Darras2016; @Depraetere2012; @Gasc2013; @Sueur2008].

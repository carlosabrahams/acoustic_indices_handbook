# Selecting acoustic indices

> [@Fuller2015] - There has been considerable interest and research to develop and compute acoustic indices that represent the characteristics of the soundscape. Early research in this field led to the application of [landscape metrics][] [reviewed in [Turner, 1989][]] to the soundscape using acoustic diversity indices [[Gage2001][], [Napoletano, 2004][]]. These indices were based on the quantification of [spectrogram][] images, calculated by dividing the spectrum into frequency bins and using automated processing of multiple spectrograms [[Gage and Napoletano, 2004][]]. A computation approach using the power density spectrum [[Welch, 1967][]] was then developed and used to characterize temporal changes in the soundscape in [Sequoia][] National Park [[Krause2011][]]. The computation of acoustic metrics from multiple recordings was further developed to compute soundscape power [Matlab code can be obtained from the authors]. Subsequently, the normalized difference soundscape index [[Joo, 2009][], [Kasten2012][]] was created to estimate the relative amount of biophony and anthrophony in the soundscape by computing the ratio of anthrophony to biophony found in field-collected acoustic recordings.

> [@Fuller2015] - [Farina[2005]][] examined [landscape ecology][] from a cognitive perspective and described new thinking about how organisms perceive landscapes according to signals and signs in the context of energy flows within the landscape. The acoustic complexity index was developed based on the observation that many biotic sounds, such as bird songs, are characterized by an intrinsic variability of intensities, while human-generated noise is often constant in intensity [[Pieretti2011][]]. [Pieretti[2011]][] found that this index correlates with the number of bird [vocalizations][], while efficiently filtering airplane noise. The acoustic complexity index has been used to describe avian soundscapes [[Farina2011][]], relate avian soundscapes to vegetation complexity [[Farina and Pieretti, 2014][]] and describe the influence of traffic noise [[Pieretti and Farina, 2013][]]. It is calculated as the average absolute fractional change in spectral amplitude, averaged over all frequency bins for the entire recording. Similarly, [Boelman[2007]][] developed a bioacoustic index which was a function of both the spectral amplitude and the number of frequency bands in a sound recording. This index was shown to be strongly correlated with avian abundance in Hawaiin forests experiencing weed invasion.

> [@Fuller2015] - Acoustic diversity indices have also been developed to facilitate automated surveying of ecosystems for rapid biodiversity appraisal [[@Sueur2008b][], [Sueur2012][]]. The acoustic entropy index is one such index and is computed as the product of both the temporal [acoustic energy dispersal within a recording] and spectral entropies [acoustic energy dispersal through the spectrum] following application of the Shannon index [[@Sueur2008b][]]. Simulations revealed a correlation between the acoustic entropy index and species diversity and in field studies this index was found to be sensitive to disturbance in Tanzanian forests [[@Sueur2008b][]]. The acoustic diversity index [[Villanueva-Rivera2011][]] is a modification of spectral entropy and is also calculated using the Shannon index, while the acoustic evenness index uses the Gini coefficient as a measure of evenness [[Villanueva-Rivera2011][]].

> [@Fuller2015] - Our comparison of six acoustic indices according to time of day revealed that two indices, the acoustic complexity ACI and the bioacoustic index BIO, presented a similar pattern that was linked to avian song intensity, but was not related to landscape and biodiversity attributes. The diversity indices, acoustic entropy H and acoustic diversity ADI, and the normalized difference soundscape index revealed high nighttime sound, as well as a dawn and dusk chorus. These indices appear to be sensitive to nocturnal biodiversity which is abundant at night in warm, subtropical environments. We argue that there is need to better understand temporal partitioning of the soundscape by specific taxonomic groups, and this should involve integrated research on amphibians, insects and birds during a 24 h cycle. The three indices that best connected the soundscape with landscape characteristics, ecological condition and bird species richness were acoustic entropy H, acoustic evenness AE and the normalized difference soundscape index.
>
> [@Fuller2015] - Our mixed model analyses indicated that only three of the tested indices [NDSI, *H* and AEI] provided a good representation of the landscape configuration. The three indices that best connected the soundscape with landscape characteristics, ecological condition and bird species richness were acoustic entropy [*H*], acoustic evenness [AEI] and the normalized difference soundscape index [NDSI]. However, caution should be used when interpreting the AEI as it provides an inverse relationship. . These analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between NDSI and landscape condition, with sites having high levels of anthropogenic sound disturbance and low biophony experiencing low biocondition and increased landscape fragmentation. Similarly, a significant positive relationship was found between *H* and biocondition. From these results, we conclude that NDSI and *H* are effective indicators of sites with small patch size, situated near residential areas, and surrounded by a large extent of roads. Likewise, NDSI and *H* indicate sites with high ecological condition that are not surrounded by residential development and have minimal extent of roads, yet vary widely in patch size. This suggests that the response of these acoustic metrics is not limited strictly to patch size, but rather they differentiate between similar sized sites with different levels of acoustical noise associated with urbanization. Based on our findings, we conclude that the NDSI and *H* are suitable indices for identifying high condition habitat within human-dominated environments. AEI was negatively associated with biocondition; high condition habitat was characterized by low acoustic evenness. During times of chorus activity in high condition habitat, one would expect less evenness across frequency bands as signals in the biophony range, especially mid- and high-frequency [songbird][] vocalizations, would exceed signals in the low frequency range of anthrophony. Most sites exhibited high variation in AEI across the 24 h sampling period. However, those sites with low variation were small patches surrounded by a high extent of local roads and therefore, low variation may signify depleted bird fauna at low condition sites affected by urbanization.

> [@Ross2021] found that acoustic richness [ARic] and the temporal entropy index [Ht] outperformed other indices in terms of their relationship with measured richness. We also identified indices that were relatively insensitive to confounding sonic conditions [H, NDSI, NDSIBio]. Practical users of these indices should take into consideration their performance across a relevant range of sonic conditions. When designing acoustic studies, researchers should tailor the selection of appropriate biodiversity facet[s] and sonic conditions to include in models to study design [[@Gasc2013], 2018; Harris2016; Hart2015]. These may differ from our chosen conditions, particularly when considering aquatic soundscapes for example [Gottesman2018; van der Lee2020]. Consideration of both performance and sensitivity across sonic conditions when selecting acoustic indices will be particularly important as ecoacoustics shifts increasingly towards answering questions of broad ecological interest [Gasc2018; Lomolino2015; Sueur2019].

> Long-duration broadband insect sounds [not encountered in the UK, as due to tropical cicadas etc] reduce the performance of acoustic indices [Ross etal 2020, @Eldridge2018]
>
> Seasonal effects on both the performance and sensitivity of many acoustic indices have ben found [@Ross2021], with H being least sensitive to seasonality [see also Mammides2017], though the generality of seasonal differences in acoustic index performance is doubtful; seasonal effects likely depend on features of the acoustic environment determined by landscape configuration and vocalising species composition [Burivalova2019b; Deichmann2018; Fuller2015; Sethi2020].
>
> [@Ross2021] -Other studies testing the performance of acoustic indices have not typically considered such a broad range of sonic conditions and land cover types as our study, likely contributing to the inconsistencies among studies testing the performance of particular acoustic indices [Bradfer-Lawrence2020; [@Eldridge2018]; Fairbrass2017; Fuller2015; Machado2017; Mammides2017; Zhao2019]. Our finding of a few well-performing indices is then particularly noteworthy given that our models included a range of confounding sonic conditions most often excluded in studies testing the performance of acoustic indices [Buxton2018a; Harris2016]. Acoustic indices were related significantly to measured richness in only three cases - best performers were ARic and Ht.
>
> [@Ross2021] Taken together, Ht, ARic, and perhaps also NDSI, or NDSIAnthro may be the most suitable indicators of richness under the full range of sonic conditions included in this study. In the case of Ht, this index fulfilled both desirable conditions: 1] it correlates with richness, and 2] performs comparatively well across the range of sonic conditions tested, though it remains sensitive to insect noise, such as cicada activity.
>
> \@[@Eldridge2018] - Observed relationships between avian species richness and BI, ACI and NDSI are largely in line with previous findings. In contrast, entropy and evenness indices [AEI, ADI, Hf, Ht] show an *inverse* relationship to many previous findings.
>
> \@[@Eldridge2018] - Compound indices are more effective than any single index in predicting species richness. Multivariate regression results demonstrating the superior performance of compound over single indices are in line with results of previous studies [[Wimmer2013][]] and follow intuition. The first generation of ecoacoustic indices aimed to provide single values of acoustic diversity; future research should focus on development and testing of a suite of complementary features for use in a compound index, capturing timbral as well as temporal and spectral characteristics. Site-specific compound indices could then be developed, for example by tuning relative weights by carrying out a PCA on a sample recording.

> 3. Use multiple indices to describe soundscape patterns. No single acoustic index can describe the entire soundscape; capturing inter‐habitat differences requires multiple indices, as there are often competing explanations for a particular index value. For example low Bio values could indicate either an impoverished soundscape with little noise or an acoustically rich environment; if the soundscape also has low H and high AEve values it would support the latter interpretation. The seven indices used in this study will not necessarily suit all situations and systems, and identifying the most appropriate indices to use will depend on study aims. Using a suite of indices will offer complimentary impressions of different aspects of the soundscape. Selection should be based on a solid understanding of the soundscape patterns underlying index values, and hence the ecological patterns they may reflect.\
> 4. Use mean values and standard deviations rather than raw values. This draws out patterns that might otherwise be obscured by shortterm variability. The magnitude of variability provides additional information, and in many cases standard deviations of indices were more important than mean values for distinguishing among the habitats.\
> 5. Consider more than just a single portion of the day. Diel patterns are important for extracting differences between habitat types. Dry season values for Bio and NDSI were near uniform among habitats between 12:00 and 17:00, but differed widely outside these hours. Conversely, the greatest variation in ACI and AEve values was during the afternoon.

> -Bradfer-Lawrence[2020] considered that sites with higher species richness had more uneven soundscapes. Ross[2020 in press] found support for this pattern with two indices not included in the Bradfer-Lawrencestudy: Ht and ARic. Ht was related negatively to measured richness, meaning that as site-level species richness increases, the temporal evenness of the soundscape decreases [@Sueur2008b]. Further, since acoustic richness values are a ranked function of both temporal entropy and the median of the amplitude envelope [M] [@Depraetere2012], the decrease in acoustic richness we observed with increased site level richness likely reflects an increase in soundscape amplitude rather than in evenness. Overall, we can thus infer that sites with higher richness of vocalising species exhibit more structurally complex [less even] but more acoustically active [louder] soundscapes [Bradfer- Lawrence2020; Dumyahn & Pijanowski 2011].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acoustic diversity indices currently in use can be categorised into one of two groups: alpha [within] or beta [between] diversity [@Doohan2019].

# Dissimilarity [D] index


> [@Doohan2019] - The **Dissimilarity [D] index** [@Sueur2008] compares differences in temporal and spectral envelopes of sound between sites (hence beta diversity), providing a measure of community diversity similar to the dissimilarity indices used in traditional ecological studies [Gorelick, 2006; @Sueur2008]. While D does not directly measure biodiversity, this index can be used to compare differences in two acoustic communities under different conditions, as well as across temporal and spatial scales [@Sueur2008].

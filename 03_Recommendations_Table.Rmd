# Recommendations under different conditions 

From [@Ross2021] 

Recommended acoustic indices based on the results of this study and others when handling audio data including different conditions: presence of geophony, anthropophony, broadband insect stridulations, or study designs including different seasons. All/unknown is when not specifically considering any of the above conditions, but all may be present in the study design, hence the recommendations in this category are conservative recommendations for where sonic conditions are highly variable.

| Study Conditions  | Recommended Indices        | Details                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| All/unknown       | Ht, ARic, NDSIAnthro, NDSI | Across all sonic conditions, Ht and ARic performed best, followed by NDSIAnthro. NDSI performed less well but was insensitive to all three sonic conditions. Bradfer-Lawrence[2020] found that species rich sites exhibit temporally variable soundscapes, and we observed this pattern in our study. |
| Anthropophony     | Ht, ARic, NDSIBio          | ARic and Ht were related significantly to richness in the presence of anthropophony in our study and in that of Depraetere[2012]. NDSIBio was insensitive to anthropophony here and elsewhere [Fairbrass2017; Kasten2012]. |
| Geophony          | Ht, ACI                    | Ht was related significantly to richness in the presence of geophony in our study. ACI was insensitive to geophony here and in SÃ¡nchez-Giraldo[2020], but did not correlate with richness. |
| Broadband Insects | BioA                       | BioA was least sensitive to insect stridulations in our study. Eldridge[2018] found BioA largely ignores high-frequency insect noise. |
| Multiple Seasons  | Ht, ARic, NDSI, H          | Ht and ARic did not differ largely between seasons in their performance. NDSI was not significantly affected by any sonic conditions when considering seasons. We found H was fairly robust to seasonality, as did Mammides[2017]. NB: seasonal effects likely differ among studies |

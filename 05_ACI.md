# Acoustic Complexity Index [ACI]

The Acoustic Complexity Index [ACI] - was designed to be related to the diversity of bird song, and hence bird species richness.

The ACI was developed to quantify complex biotic sounds according to the variability of the intensities recorded, while filtering out background human-generated noise [anthrophony]. The algorithm is based on the observation that many biotic sounds, including bird songs [for which it was principally developed], typically have frequent dynamic changes in their volume, while many types of human generated noise have constant amplitude - such as the drones or rumbles of traffic noise [Farina 2008; Pieretti 2011]. The ACI provides a measure of how much the sound intensity varies over time, by calculating the differences in amplitude, for a range of frequency bins, between adjacent time periods in a recording. In this way, the ACI extracts the majority of biologically produced sound while reducing the non-biotic sounds and the effects of distance of sound from the microphone.

When applying the ACI, it is necessary to note that strong intensity modulations can sometimes be generated by humans, or weather conditions. The ACI is resistant to continuous noise, such as aeroplane flights overhead or traffic noise, but sensitive to variable noise sources such as rain and irregular machine activity. These intermittent, irregular man-made sounds can cause a rapid variation of intensities, and a correspondingly high ACI score. Accordingly, the ACI should be used preferably in more semi-natural soundscapes, where any anthropogenic noise present in the soundscape is characterized by constant intensities, rather than in complex, noisy urban environments. In addition, although the ACI algorithm reduces the variability introduced by the singing organisms being different distances from the recording microphones, it is still moderately sensitive to the proximity of the sound source and close sounds will result in a higher ACI value than those at greater distance.

> [@Myers2019] -The **Acoustic Complexity Index** [[Pieretti2011][]] was created as a quick and direct means of quantifying the complexity of avian acoustics and to capture subtler changes in bird behaviour, despite the presence of anthropogenic noise. It is based on the assumption that biotic sounds, such as bird songs, are characterised by an intrinsic variability of intensities, while some types of human generated noise present very constant intensity values [[Eldridge2016][]]. By calculating the variability of intensities within a spectrogram, ACI captures the dynamic changes in a soundscape and is used as an estimate of the diversity of an acoustic community [[@Towsey2014][]]. ACI has been shown to be relatively insensitive to variations in the intensity of bird songs and provides an accurate measure of avian diversity, that correlates with manually recorded bird [vocalisation][] data sources [[Pierettiet al., 2011][], [Gascet al., 2015][]]. ACI is calculated by dividing the spectrogram into frequency bins, quantifying the fractional change in spectral amplitude, and then averaging over all frequency bins. In a comparison of 12 indices by [Towsey[2014][]], ACI was shown to be one of the most effective at identifying bird species with an accuracy of 62.8% compared to audio identification by experts. [Pieretti[2011]][] found that ACI strongly correlated with the number of bird [vocalisations][] in recorded calls but was insensitive to anthropogenic noise. Though it is important to note that these indices may perform differently due to environmental conditions. ACI is particularly sensitive to disturbing noises such as wind and rain, which could explain its poor performance under tropical weather conditions.

> [@Ross2021] found that *ACI* was insensitive to most background sounds with the exception of insect noise [see also [@Eldridge2018]; Pieretti2011]. However, its poor performance makes ACI a poor indicator of species richness [Mammides2017; Ross2020].

> \@[@Eldridge2018] - In response to observations that many indices are over-sensitive to 'background' noise, the Acoustic Complexity Index [ACI] was developed [[Pieretti2011][]]. ACI reports short-time averaged changes in energy across frequency bins, with the aim of capturing transient biophonic sounds, whilst being insensitive to more continuous technophonies such as airplanes and other engines. ACI has been reported to correlate significantly with the number of avian [vocalisations][] in an Italian national park [[Pieretti2011][]], with observed species evenness and diversity in temperate reefs [[Harris2016][]] and to be positively related to observed changes in migratory avian species numbers in a multi-year Alaskan study [[Buxton2016][]]. A recent urban study reports correlations between ACI and biotic activity and diversity, as well as anthrophonic signals [[Fairbrass2017][]], as expected, given the full range analyses carried out.

> \@[@Eldridge2018] - Correlations between ACI and species richness in the UK are in line with many previous findings which report positive relationships between ACI and number of avian vocalisations [[Pieretti2011][]] and reef fish abundance in temperate [[Harris2016][]] and tropical [[Bertucci2016][]] marine environments. The weaker relationship between ACI and observed species richness and negative relationship to biophonic diversity in Ecuador is understandable given the other biophonies present: ACI acts as an event detector, so it will likely track insect and amphibian calls with rapid onsets; similar negative trends have recently been reported in other areas of high species diversity [[Mammides2017][]]. It is of note but not surprising that median values performed a little better than the standard mean value, being less susceptible to extreme changes which may be due to wind, electronic error or other biasing outliers. **Median, rather than mean values may be more robust metrics in general**.
